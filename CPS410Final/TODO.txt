Account.cs

1) Think about creating a dropdownlist for selecting majors and binding it to a database table that is filled with possible majors
	a) would have to allow nulls
	b) would have to include an option for users to request a major to be added
	c) talk to brad about only having one account information page based on student/tutor (i.e., a tutor account can only see the tutor information page)
2) On Account.aspx page, when logged in, pull their data into the appropriate page control (if the data exists)
3) fix account overview, add the information the account has in the database
4) double check the edit information tab under account page to see if the information actually gets processed
