3) Handle changing passwords, forgotten passwords, forgotten usernames, etc.


Registration.aspx

Login.aspx

Account.cs
-----------------
1) Possibly link to a new page showing an example of what to write for a tutor AND for a student
2) DECIDE two things:
	a) Decide on redirect to "Edit information" once a new account is registered
	b) Decide if all fields on edit information should be required (for students)

Database.cs/Login.aspx
----------------------
1) Set an error message when, upon login attempt, no user with that information is found\
2) ON DATABASE FILES, comment each one and explain what the fields are supposed to be


Admin Console
-----------------
1) Assign users new roles
2) Create new Subjects (all users can create posts, only admins can create subjects)
3) Delete/Ban users, delete/rename Subjects


FOR EACH DIV ON ACCOUNT PAGE
----------------------------
1) Add a status label. So for passwords, it would be a label with id "lblPasswordStatus". Check the Account.aspx.cs class for what the labels
	should be called.
2) If the user currently logged in is a tutor, at the bottom of the menu on the left side show a new div that is labeled
	something like "Tutor Information". This is strictly for tutors to fill out their "tutor profile" (e.g., places of employment,
	degrees earned, years of experience, etc.)


TAYLOR
------
1) Think about creating a dropdownlist for selecting majors and binding it to a database table that is filled with possible majors
	a) would have to allow nulls
	b) would have to include an option for users to request a major to be added
	c) talk to brad about only having one account information page based on student/tutor (i.e., a tutor account can only see the tutor information page)
2) On Account.aspx page, when logged in, pull their data into the appropriate page control (if the data exists)
